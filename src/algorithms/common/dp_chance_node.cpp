     * Implements a dp backup for decision nodes.
     * 
     * I.e. Q(s,a) = R(s,a) + E_{s'}[V(s')]
     * 
     * Implemented as a running average to avoid using two loops. Feels like it should be more efficient, but would be 
     * nice to check at some point if really optimising.
     * 
     * Made 'sum_child_backups' a double to force computations to all be floating point rather than integer (otherwise 
     * get an integer div).
     * 
     * Additional note on concurrency fun. It is possible and valid to currently have a child with zero backups. 
     * Consider if we have another trial that also searches this node, it made a new child, but hasn't backed it up 
     * yet. Hence it's necessary to include the line "if (child.num_backups == 0) continue;" to avoid a division by 
     * zero causing NaNs.
