     * An abstract base class for Chance Nodes.
     * 
     * This class provides some base implementations that can be useful across different Thts algorithms. Including 
     * a transposition table implementation and pretty print functions for debugging.
     * 
     * Member variables:
     *      node_lock: A mutex that is used to protect this entire node.
     *      thts_manager: 
     *          A ThtsManager object that stores the 'global' information about how the Thts algorithm should operate,
     *          so that an implementation can provide multiple modes of operation. Additionally stores the 
     *          transposition tables
     *      state:
     *          The state associated with this node
     *      action:
     *          The action associated with this node
     *      decision_depth:
     *          The decision depth of the node in this tree
     *      decision_timestep:
     *          The timestep corresponding to the current state in the larger planning problem. This is necessary 
     *          when the Thts algorithm is used at each timestep to make a decision. For example, this is necessary in 
     *          a two player game to decide who's turn it is
     *      num_visits:
     *          The number of times the node has been visited (had the 'visit' function called)
     *      parent:
     *          A pointer to this nodes parent node. nullptr if this node is the root node
     *      children:
     *          A map from Action objects to child ThtsCNode objects
