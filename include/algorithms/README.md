# Code Overview - include/algorithms/

This directory contains all of the implementations of standard algorithms.






## common/

A folder containing code that is shared between multiple algorithms without any obvious heirarchical relation. For 
example nodes implementing dynamic programming backups are contained here.

## est/

Contains the implementation of EST

## ments/

Contains MENTS and it's derivative algorithms:
1. MENTS
2. Empirical MENTS
3. DB-MENTS

And contains the directories:
3. ments/dents/
1. ments/rents/ 
2. ments/tents/

## ments/dents/

Contains the implementation of DENTS

## ments/rents/

Contains implementation of RENTS, which is MENTS using Relative entropy

## ments/tents/

Contains implementation of TENTS, which is MENTS using Tsallis entropy

## uct/

Contains implementations related to UCT:
1. UCT
2. Polnomial UCT
