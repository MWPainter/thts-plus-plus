# Simplex Maps For Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search (aka the `xpr_mo` branch of THTS++)

Branch forks from `xprmntl_mo` which implements the Multi-Objective algorithms, this branch adds and contains experiments for the Multi-Objective algorithms

Additionally, this will contain replicated experiments from [Convex Hull Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04445) for my thesis plots
